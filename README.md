DATA ACQUISITION &amp; RETRIEVING ENVOY : Black-box data recovery using drones
We are suggesting a system concept t can improve the efficiency of black-box data recovery during a plane crash/missing 
this will be helpful to start a search and rescue operation as soon as possible which may save several lives and money. 
As we know all information, including the exact location of a plane crash is recorded inside the Black box, 
but this data is not useful for a rescue operation because it goes with the plane. 

Our aim is to develop a system that can continuously analyse the parameters for a secure flight and
if these parameters are compromised the system should be able to copy important data (like location) 
from the black-box and ejects from the plane, then autonomously fly to a safe location in the ground 
using a preloaded map (like unmanned aerial vehicles).
