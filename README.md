DATA ACQUISITION &amp; RETRIEVING ENVOY : Black-box data recovery using drones.

In March 2014,  we all heard about the missing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, but even after several days and months,  the rescue operation didn't become successful. Likewise, there are so many cases around the globe about missing/crashed aeroplanes, submarines and ships. 
The ultimate aim of this project is to design and develop a device that helps to retrieve the data from the black-box/captains deck to a safe place on the ground through air/water
